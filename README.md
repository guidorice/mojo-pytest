[![Run Tests](https://github.com/guidorice/mojo-pytest/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/guidorice/mojo-pytest/actions/workflows/test.yml)

[Mojoüî•](https://github.com/modularml/mojo) language test runner plugin for [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org). Try it for
your mixed Python and Mojo codebases!

## Design

This package implements a `pytest` plugin to discover and run mojo tests, alongside your Python tests. Although `pytest`
does not have any awareness of Mojo source or package structure, `pytest` is extensible. In summary, `plugin.py` calls
`mojo test` in a sub-process and parses the outputs and exit codes.

## Usage

1. Create your Mojo tests according to the manual: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/tools/testing .

2. Install `pytest` and `pytest-mojo` plugin into your project
    with `pip install git+https://github.com/guidorice/mojo-pytest.git`, or with the Conda
    [environment.yaml](./environment.yaml) (recommended)
    ```shell
    # conda installation example
    $ conda env create -f environment.yaml -p ./env
    $ conda activate ./env

    # verify pytest and the Mojo plugin are installed
    $ pytest --version
    $ pip show pytest-mojo
    ...
    ```

3. See the example project for one possible filesystem layout:
    - `example_src/` has it's tests in the `example_tests/` folder.
    - Remember the [Mojo manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/tools/testing) explains
    that tests are allowed to be in the same folder as Mojo code, or different folder, or even as Mojo code in
    docstrings! So this example project is just one possibility.
4. Mojo tests and Python tests are all run via `pytest`! Use the plugin's `--mojo-include` option to include your
   Mojo packages.

    ```shell
    # this example_src/ contains a Python package which is also called from Mojo,
    # so we must add it using PYTHONPATH. Please note that the full path may be required!
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/Users/you/project/example_src/

    # Use the plugin's --mojo-include option to tell mojo where to find `my_package` 
    $ pytest --mojo-include example_src/ example_tests/

    ```

    üëÜüèΩ Notice how your Python tests are run alongside your mojo tests.

5. Mojo binary packages are also supported with `--mojo-include`. For example, this could be used in a CI/CD script:

    ```shell
        $ mojo package example_src/my_package -o build/my_package.mojopkg  # or .üì¶
        $ pytest --mojo-include build/ example_tests/
        ... 
        ... (same pytest output as above)
        ...
    ```

See also, the [pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org) for many more options.

## Example Project

In the `example_src/` directory is a Mojo package with a couple of modules. There is also a Python module, which we call
in two ways (from `pytest`, and from Mojo). Here is an overview:

```shell
example_src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.mojo                    # main entry point. run with `mojo example_src/main.mojo`
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_package
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.mojo            # this is both Mojo package, and a Python package.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci.mojo           # Mojo implementation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fibonacci.py             # Python implementation
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ random_tensor.mojo       # random tensor stuff

example_tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_package
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_test.mojo             # files can be named xxx_test as well as test_xxx.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_fibonacci.mojo      # tests the Mojo impl and the Python impl.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_fibonacci.py        # tests the Python impl (pure Python).
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_fire.üî•             # tests are collected for fire extension too.
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_random_tensor.mojo  # tests the Mojo impl.
```
